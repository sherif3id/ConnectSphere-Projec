# ConnectSphere - User Management App

Welcome to **ConnectSphere**, a stylish web app that makes managing users a breeze! This project brings together a smooth interface and strong backend to handle your user needs.

## What It Does
- Sign up new users with ease.
- Log in securely.
- View, delete, or clear users in a cool table.
- Stores everything safely with MySQL.

The design pops with red (#dc3545) and orange (#fd7e14) colors!

## How It’s Organized
The project is split into two cool parts:
- **Backend**: The brain of the app, handling MySQL in `server.js`.
- **Frontend**: The look and feel, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in `assets`.
